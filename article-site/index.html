			<h1>The Medium is the Massage</h1>
			<h2>McLuhan Reading Response</h2>
			<div class="article fade">
				<p>Written by Marshall McLuhan, “The Medium is the Massage” is about how different mediums of media have influenced the way we think and act in every part of our lives. Originally, the book was supposed to be titled the medium is the message, but due to a printing error, was changed to massage which McLuhan loved. Perhaps because the word massage could reference the way the media is “massaging” our brains to behave differently.</p>

				<p>So, the question is, what does the medium is the message mean? The title means that, in our current day and age, the process by which we send and receive information has become increasingly more important than what the information itself says. This is due to new forms of media. While humans were once only consumers of media, consuming and absorbing information through radio or television, we have moved past pure consumption and begun producing our own media and information to be shared. One example of this is through television shows, where we are now able to immediately connect with people all over the world who also enjoyed the show and share our thoughts with them.</p>

Online activism has paved the way for new forms of uniting those who are passionate in involvement relating to hot-button issues.</span></p>
